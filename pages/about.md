## About the Collection

The digital collection will include digitized and digital-born materials centered on the topics of the LGBT community here in the Philippines. The digital objects found in this may be in the following form:

1. Images – This may include digitized photographs, digital images, drawings, logos, posters, and other visual materials representing the movie, series, or book.
2. Texts – This includes written reviews about the movie, series, or book that may be shared publicly.


The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
